    Version 2.00.00 (2020-06-12)
  </div>

  <h1 class="western">Installing and launching FullSWOF_UI</h1>

  <p class="western">This version of FullSWOF_UI is compatible with
  FullSWOF_1D Version 1.02.02 and FullSWOF_2D Version 1.09.01.</p>

  <p class="western">You must have Java 1.8 or later installed to run FullSWOF_UI.</p>

  <p class="western">The FullSWOF development team uses the version 11 of Java to test FullSWOF_UI.
    So, when we make a new release, we guarantee that you can run FullSWOF_UI with the version 11 of Java.<br/>
    To verify the version of Java installed on your system, you can use the following command in a terminal:</p>
  
  <p class="c3">java -version</p>

  <p class="western">You do not need to have FullSWOF_1D or FullSWOF_2 to run
  FullSWOF_UI, but you will not be able to run simulations without these
  applications.</p>

  <p class="western">To launch FullSWOF_UI in a terminal, use the following command in
  the directory that contains the file FullSWOF_UI.jar (do not extract this file) :</p>

  <p class="western c3">java -jar FullSWOF_UI.jar</p>

  <p class="western">Depending on your system, you may be able to lauch FullSWOF_UI by
  right-clicking on the .jar file and opening it with Java.</p>

  <h1 class="western">FullSWOF parameters</h1>

  <h2 class="western">Creating or opening a project</h2>

  <p class="western">FullSWOF_UI allows you to work on project files with the extension
  .fsp. Each project is linked to a FullSWOF configuration (either FullSWOF_1D or
  FullSWOF_2D). To change the configuration used, choose a configuration in the
  preferences (under 'FullSWOF') then create a new project. You can save the project with
  <i>'File &gt; Save the project'</i> (Ctrl + S) or save it under a new name with
  <i>'File &gt; Save project as ...'</i>. Saving the project will create a .fsp file and a
  directory that contains the project data. This directory will also contain the output
  files. Do not change the name of this directory.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Importing a parameters file</h2>

  <p class="western">In order to reuse data that was not created with FullSWOF_UI, you
  must use the command <i>'Import a parameters file'</i>. This command will try to read
  data from a file that follows the format of <i>parameters.txt</i>. Be sure to set the
  right FullSWOF configuration (1D or 2D) when you create the project, before you import
  the file.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Set the parameters</h2>

  <p class="western">FullSWOF_UI allows you to easily set the parameters needed to run
  FullSWOF. You only have to set the values of the different fields. Some fields accept
  integers, others decimal numbers. If the value is incorrect the field will be
  highlighted in red. For more information about the different parameters, please read
  the FullSWOF user manual.</p>

  <p class="western">N.B. : Decimal numbers can be written using the standard notation
  1.234 or the scientific notation 1.23e-4.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Other files</h2>

  <p class="western">You can visualize input files (such as topography files, huv files,
  rain files) once you have indicated their path. The <i>'visualize'</i> button opens a
  window showing a chart or a 3D representation of the file data. 3D figures can be
  manipulated like those in output files view.</p>

  <p class="western">When you indicate a path to an input file, FullSWOF_UI will try to
  copy this file in the '<i>Inputs</i>' directory of the project. However this copy may
  fail with very large files (2Gb or more). If this happens, manually copy the file in
  the directory named <i>'Inputs'</i> and indicate this new file as parameter of the
  project.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Generating input files</h2>

  <p class="western">You can generate input files using FullSWOF_UI. Rain files are
  generated using a table of values, while huv and topography files may be created using
  a formula parser. You can set a parameter according to the value of the variables x, y
  and t, for example z = sin(x + y).</p>

  <p class="western">You must set the domain parameters before you can generate these
  files (under Space &amp; Time).</p>

  <p class="western">Please note that variables x, y or t may not always be useful
  (for example y in the case of a FullSWOF_1D file or t in the case of a spatial
  description file). If this is the case, the value of this variable is 0.</p>

  <h1 class="western">Calculation</h1>

  <p class="western">In order to run FullSWOF with the project parameters, you must first
  indicate the path to the binary executable FullSWOF file in the preferences (under
  <i>'FullSWOF'</i>).</p>

  <p class="western">Then you can launch the computation using <i>File &gt; Run
  simulation</i> or F5.</p>

  <p class="western">Messages from FullSWOF are written in a console, which also indicate
  the progression of the simulation and gives you the ability to interrupt FullSWOF. You
  can also activate the view of the output file while it is being created by
  FullSWOF. In this case you will be able to visualize the file up to the last time step
  computed. This functionality may slow down FullSWOF. It can be deactivated in the
  preferences.</p>

  <h1 class="western">Output files view</h1>

  <p class="western">You can visualize output file previously computed by FullSWOF using
  <i>File &gt; Open output files</i></p>

  <p class="western">This functionality allows to visualize only Gnuplot and VTK files
  created by FullSWOF_1D or FullSWOF_2D. These files are usually named <i>huv_evolution</i>.
  Files named <i>huv_initial</i> and <i>huv_final</i> can be read, but they do not show the evolution
  of the simulation.</p>

  <h2 class="western">VTK files</h2>

  <p class="western">VTK files produced by FullSWOF_2D can be read, but they do not
  include the time value of each time step. The interface uses default values instead,
  which will usually be different from those included in Gnuplot files. The same
  simulation will produce slightly different visualizations depending on the file format.
  Gnuplot format should be used.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Spatial view</h2>

  <p class="western">The tab shows a spatial view of the simulation. You can
  play the animation showing the evolution using the buttons at the bottom of the panel.
  This animation is only available if the file contains multiple time steps.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Boundaries evolution</h2>

  <p class="western">If the file contains multiple time steps, the evolution tabs will be
  activated. They display diagrams showing the evolution of values during time. The
  values displayable for each boundary are the instant discharge, the cumulated discharge
  and the water height.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Manipulating 3D figures</h2>

  <p class="western">Output files generated by FullSWOF_2D are shown as 3D figures. You
  can rotate the figure with the mouse (left button). To drag the figure, keep the wheel
  down and move the mouse. To zoom in or out, use the wheel.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Exporting diagrams and adding data</h2>

  <p class="western">You can add data to the diagrams or export them as image files.
  Right-click on the diagram and choose the appropriate item in the pop-up menu. These
  functionalities are not available on 3D figures.</p>

  <p class="western">Supported image file formats depend on your Java configuration, but
  PNG (recommended), GIF and JPEG formats should usually be supported. The format of the
  image file produced depend on the extension that you indicate when you save the
  file.</p>

  <p class="western">To add custom data to a diagram, you must use a data file in which
  each line describes a point with the following format : x y. You can choose to display
  this data as a line or as a group of points. You can later erase this data using the
  diagram pop-up menu.</p>

  <h1 class="western">FullSWOF_UI preferences</h1>

  <p class="western">You can access the application preferences under <i>Configuration
  &gt; Preferences</i></p>

  <p class="western">The preferences are stored in your user directory, in a hidden
  directory named <i>.fullswof_ui</i></p>

  <h2 class="western">General</h2>

  <p class="western">The default language used by FullSWOF_UI is that of the system,
  provided that the translation is available (currently English and French translations
  are provided), or English by default. You can choose one of the language available in
  this menu. This choice will only be visible after you restart the application.</p>

  <p class="western">If you select the <i>'Include parameters description'</i> box, FullSWOF_UI
  will add a description for each parameter included in the project <i>parameters.txt</i>
  file. Otherwise the file will only contain tags and their values.</p>

  <h2 class="western">FullSWOF</h2>

  <p class="western">This tab lets you indicate the command to be used in order to run
  FullSWOF. It also lets you choose the default configuration for new projects.</p>

  <h2 class="western">Visualization</h2>

  <p class="western">This tab allows you to choose view settings. You can choose
  to visualize files that are being created by FullSWOF. However, this functionality may
  slow down FullSWOF.</p>

  <p class="western">You can also choose the data to be displayed on spatial
    view figures, as well as the color used for each data type.</p>

  <p class="western"> Please note, we noticed certain problem with Windows that's why we have to remove this option by default.</p>
