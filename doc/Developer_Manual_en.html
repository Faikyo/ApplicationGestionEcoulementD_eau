<h1 class="western">Creation of a configuration tree</h1>

<p class="western">The architecture of FullSWOF_UI is
designed to allow an easy modification of the number and type of
entry parameters used by FullSWOF, and, at the same time, to allow
the user to choose among various configurations. The configurations
available today are for FullSWOF_1D and FullSWOF_2D. To ensure a
backward-compatibility, it is recommended to create a configuration
for each major version of FullSWOF instead of modifying the 1D and 2D
existing configurations.</p>

<h2 class="western">Create a configuration</h2>

<p class="western">All the classes required for the
creation of a configuration are located in the package <i>model</i>.
For more information, look at the documentation of these classes.</p>

<p class="western">A configuration is a tree, made of
objects of type <i>Node</i>. While the creation of a node is simple,
to describe a configuration fully often require numerous lines of
code. For the clarity of the code, it is recommended to create a
configuration using a static method located in a class completely
dedicated to the creation of this object. This method will return the
tree root, to which had been attached the other nodes. Put this class
in the package <i>model.definition</i> which already contains the
classes dedicated to the building of the 1D and 2D configurations.</p>

<p class="western">Every visible item of the
configuration panel match one node. This is valid for the parameters
themselves (<i>ExternalNode</i>) but also for the parameter groups
(<i>InternalNode</i>) such as the various tabs of the parametrization
panel or the groups of parameters on a single page (for example the
group «&nbsp;left limit&nbsp;» located in the tab «&nbsp;Limits&nbsp;»).</p>

<h2 class="western">Creation of the root and internal
nodes</h2>

<p class="western">launch.Start by creating the root tree, with
the type <i>RootNode</i>. It is to this object that it should be
pointed to make reference to the whole tree.</p>
<p class="code-western">Node root = new RootNode(String
name, String description);</p>

<p class="western">Be careful that the name of this none
is the one of the configuration, and is sometimes used by the code,
for example to open a previously-created file. Be careful not to
change it or to use a name already existing for another
configuration.</p>

<p class="western">Then create the internal nodes and
add them to the parent node:</p>
<p class="code-western">Node node1 = new
InternalNode(String name);</p>

<p class="code-western">root.addNode(node1);</p>

<p class="western">The first level of internal nodes
will be the tabs in the parameterization panel, and the lower levels
will be displayed as frames in the page. There is no limit to the
number of imbricated levels.</p>

<h2 class="western">Creation of the parameters</h2>

<p class="western">Once the parameter groups have been
created, the parameters have to be added. All the parameters come
from the abstract class <i>ExternalNode</i>. For a detailed
description of each type of parameter, look at the Doxygen
documentation of the class <i>ExternalNode</i> and of the classes
that origin from it. Here is an abstract of the most useful classes:</p>

<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>FieldParameter</i>: text
	field accepting any value</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>FileParameter</i>: allow to
	specify the path to a file</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>IntegerParameter</i>:
	Integer number (with the possibility to define a range of accepted
	values)</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>FloatParameter</i>: Float
	number (with the possibility to define a range of accepted values)</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>MultipleChoiceParameter</i>:
	Parameter for a finite set of possible values (displayed as a
	drop-down menu). To add values, use the command
	addPossibleValue(String name, String value)</p>
</ul>

<p class="western">The other classes extending
<i>ExternalNode</i> are parameters with specific behaviors (such as
the suffix of the output directory) or external nodes which are not
parameters (such as the nodes used to create entry files).</p>

<h2 class="western">Dependencies</h2>

<p class="western">For the value of a node to activate a
reaction on other nodes, it is required to create a dependency
(abstract class <i>Dependency</i>). A dependency alwas has a “master”
node, a “slave” node and a target value. If the value of the
master node is equal to the target value, a change is carried out on
the slave node. This tool is quite useful with the parameters having
multiple choices. Hence, a specific choice can deactivate other
parameters or change their value. However, the dependencies can be
used for every type of parameter.</p>

<p class="western">The following example, allow to
deactivate the parameter node2 if the parameter node1 has the value
«&nbsp;4&nbsp;». Creating the object is enough to make active the
dependency.</p>

<p class="code-western">new DisablingDependency(node1,
node2, &quot;4&quot;);</p>

<p class="western">The current code define three types
of dependencies:</p>

<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>DisablingDependency :</i>
	allow to deactivate the slave node for a specific value of the
	master node. Be careful that the slave node is not re-activated
	automatically if the value of the master node is modified afterward.
	To have such behavior, you have to use  <i>EnablingDependency</i> of
	the other possible values of the master node.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>EnablingDependency :</i>
	allow the opposite behavior.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western"><i>SettingDependency :</i>
	modify the value of the target parameter when the main parameter has
	a specific value.</p>
</ul>

<h2 class="western">Activate the configuration</h2>

<p class="western">Once the configuration has been
created, it must be added to the list of used configurations. They
are inside the class <i>launch.Procedures</i>, as a variable (table)
named <i>AVAILABLE_CONFIGURATIONS</i>. Add your configuration to this
table as a call to the creation function of the configuration. This
is the root of the tree configuration that should be returned by this
function.</p>

<p class="western">The created class and the
<i>launch.Procedures class must me compiled </i>(command javac), and the
created files .class added to the jar archive. To each package
matches a directory where the file .class should be put. As for the
whole project, all the new classes should be compiled using Java&nbsp;6 (or above).</p>

<p class="western">If you prefer to recompile the whole
project, you must use the export tool of Eclipse (File &gt; Export &gt;
Runnable jar file). This is one of the only tools that allow for the
creation of a jar containing other jar, which is not allowed by the
usual command java -jar.</p>

<h2 class="western">Localization of parameters</h2>

<p class="western">To keep the multi-language feature of
FullSWOF_UI, it is better not to write directly the names and
descriptions of the parameters directly into the class. It is
recommended to create a localization file for your configuration and
to put it in its own directory (see below).</p>

<p class="western">To access to this localization,
create a  <i>ResourceBundle</i> with (this example suppose that the
default localization file is in the folder <i>/l10n/myconfig/</i> and
is named <i>Config.properties</i>):</p>

<p class="code-western">ResourceBundle messages =
	ResourceBundle.getBundle(&quot;l10n.myconfig.Config&quot;,
	launch.Start.currentLocale);</p>

<p class="western">This command will convert the
messages in the designated language if it is available. Never specify
the country code in the recovery method of <i>ResourceBundle</i>.</p>

<p class="western">Then, instead of writing directly the
name of the parameter in the class, write:</p>

<p class="code-western">messages.getString(&quot;key&quot;);</p>

<p class="western">And your localization file should
include the line:</p>

<p class="code-western">key = Name of parameter</p>

<p class="western">The only exception to this rule is
the name of the root configuration (<i>RootNode</i>) which should be
written directly into the class and be different from the other
configuration names.</p>

<p class="western">For more details, look at the Oracle
documentation for the class <i>ResourceBundle</i>.</p>

<h1 class="western">Localization</h1>

<p class="western">FullSWOF_UI is fully
internationalized, i.e. the user messages are not written directly
into the code. The software load on launch the messages from a file,
which allow to choose easily the language. The localization is
defined as giving a file containing the translations for the messages
in a specific language. The interface is currently localized in
French and English. Adding of a new localization can be done without
recompiling the jar archive. Adding the localization files is enough
to get the new language displayed as a new choice in the preference
interface.</p>

<p class="western">The localization files are only text
files with a list of pair key/value. To create a localization file,
copy the content of the default file (see file naming) and replace
the values with the suitable  translation. The key should remain
identical. If a key is missing from your file, the interface with use
the corresponding value of the default file.</p>

<p class="western">Some words (for example the answers
“Yes”, “No” and “Cancel” of the dialog boxes) are not
defined by the localization files but by the Java virtual machine.
The virtual machine installed on the user's computer may not have the
translation for these words in the selected localization. In this
case, these words will be displayed in language different from the
one chosen for the interface (the default language of the JVM).</p>

<h2 class="western">File naming</h2>

<p class="western">The localization files are
distributed withing several folders located in the directory <i>/l10n</i>
of the jar archive. In each folder, there are several files with a
name always using the pattern name_CountryCode.extension (e.g.
<i>UIMessages_fr.properties</i>). For a localization file to be taken
into account, it must follow this pattern. The contry code is a
two-letter code defined by the ISO&nbsp;639 standard. 
</p>

<p class="western">Moreover, each folder has a file
without country code. It is the default localization. If a
translation key is not available in one of the created localization
file, the key located inside the default file will be used instead.</p>
<h2 class="western">The different localization files</h2>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
The localization files are distributed inside several directories.
Each directory matches one type of file and contains the different
localizations available for this file type.</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	<i>/l10n/controller</i> contains the files <i>UIMessages</i>. They are the
	main messages of the interface. If you want to add a localization,
	you need to create a file <i>UIMessages</i> with the suitable
	country code. The existence of this file while allow the display of
	the language in the preferences. Please, note that this file, as the
	others, can be empty or incomplete. In such case, the interface will
	use the translations of the default file.</p>
	<li/>

<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	<i>/l10n/config</i> contains the localization files specific to each
	configuration of parameters (a directory for each configuration:
	FullSWOF_1D, FullSWOF_2D...). We recommend to create a new directory
	for each defined configuration instead of re-use the file for other
	configuration, even if numerous keys are identical.</p>
	<li/>

<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	<i>/l10n/manual</i> contains the user manual displayed by the
	interface. Unlike the other files, it is an HTML file wich content
	is displayed in a window of the software.</p>
